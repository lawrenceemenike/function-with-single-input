# Review: 
# Create a function called greet(). 
name = input('please what is your name? ')
def greet(name):
  print(f'Hello friend {name}')
  print(f'Sure you are okay {name}?')
  print(f'just making sure you are {name}')

greet(name)


# Write 3 print statements inside the function.
# Call the greet() function and run your code.
